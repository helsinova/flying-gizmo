# flying-gizmo

*Dynamics Control for flying mechatronics*

* *Even bricks **do** fly*
* *Code **can** run on anything*

These are the mottos for this project. Most people will have it that this
isn't true.  Besides proving it is (and that the only reason why not is when
the truth is in the beholder, is to exercise ***how*** and having lot's of
_fun_ with technology. 

* *Control is Math*
* *Programming is secondary*

The final aim is to design a **Zeppelin Drone** capable of autonomous flying
indoors in public spaces carrying illuminated billboards or signs.

On the way we will make a lot of standalone experiments/labs and probably
some smaller projects and experiments to satisfy that each step in the
***how*** is well grounded.

** Why is Github so sucky?** Answer: FOSS have been invaded by IT-Muppets (a.k.a.
*Muppets*).
