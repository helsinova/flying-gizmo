*Dynamics Control for flying mechatronics*

* *Even bricks fly*
* *Code runs on anything*

These are the mottos for this project. Most people will have it that this isn't true. 
Besides proving it is (and that the only reason why not is when the truth is in the
beholder, is to exercise ***how*** and having lot's of _fun_ with technology. 

* *Control is Math*
* *Programming is secondary*

The final aim is to design a **Zeppelin Drone** capable of autonomous flying indoors in public spaces carrying illuminated billboards or signs.

On the way we will make a lot of lots of smaller projects and experiments to satisfy that each step in the ***how*** is well grounded.
